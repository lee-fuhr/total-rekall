Feature 25: Memory Relationships Graph

Tracks explicit relationships between memories: "led_to", "contradicts", "references", "supports".

Enables:
- Graph queries: "What led to this insight?"
- Contradiction detection: "Does this conflict with anything?"
- Citation tracking: "What references this memory?"
- Support network: "What evidence backs this up?"

Database: intelligence.db (memory_relationships table)
