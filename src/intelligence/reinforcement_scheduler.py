Feature 27: Memory Reinforcement Scheduler

Schedules memory reviews based on FSRS-6 spaced repetition intervals.

Use cases:
- Surface memories due for review
- Track review history
- Adjust scheduling based on grades
- Daily review digest

Integration:
- Reads FSRS state from fsrs.db
- Updates review schedule in intelligence.db
- Works with pattern_detector for reinforcement recording
