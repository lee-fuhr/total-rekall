"""
SQLite Connection Pooling

Fixes P2 performance issue: Prevents SQLITE_BUSY errors under concurrent operations.

Problem:
- Every module creates raw sqlite3.connect() calls
- Concurrent access causes lock contention
- SQLITE_BUSY errors and retry loops

Solution:
- Connection pool with configurable size
- Automatic timeout + retry with exponential backoff
- Context manager for safe resource management

Usage:
    from db_pool import get_connection

    with get_connection(db_path) as conn:
        cursor = conn.execute("SELECT ...")
        # Connection automatically returned to pool
