## Progress Log

### 2026-02-13 08:40 - Step 0: File Cleanup ✅
- Created `_archive/` directory structure
- Moved obsolete files:
  - `PHASE-*.md` → `_archive/build-sprints/`
  - `FINAL-STATUS.md`, `WILD-FEATURES-SUMMARY.md` → `_archive/`
  - Old QA passes → `_archive/qa-passes/`
  - `_working/` → `_archive/working-2026-02-12/`
- Added `_archive/` to `.gitignore`
- Verification: 11 active .md files (down from 17)

### 2026-02-13 08:45 - Step 1: Fix IntelligenceDB Initialization Bug ✅
- **Root cause:** `self.conn` was being accessed before initialization at line 45
- **Fix:** Initialize connection from pool before setting `row_factory`
- **Additional fix:** Added `__setattr__` to `PooledConnection` to properly proxy attribute writes to underlying sqlite3 connection
- **Verification:** All 12 `test_intelligence_db.py` tests now passing (was 0/12)

### 2026-02-13 08:50 - Step 2: Fix MemoryTSClient API Mismatch ✅
- **Root cause:** `session_consolidator.py` line 564 called `search(query=..., limit=...)` but `MemoryTSClient.search()` only accepts `content`, `tags`, `scope`, `project_id`
- **Fix:** Changed `query=` to `content=`, removed non-existent `limit` parameter
- **Verification:** `test_session_consolidator.py` 25/26 passing (was 14/26). Remaining failure is deduplication LLM timeout (Step 5)

## Current State

- **Features Shipped:** 35 (F1-22 + F23, F33-35, F44-50, F55, F62-63)
- **Features Coded:** 5 (F57, F61, F75 - need tests)
- **Features Planned:** 35 (F24-32, F36-43, F51-54, F56, F58-60, F64-74)
- **Test Status:** 361/372 passing (97%)
- **GitHub:** lee-fuhr/memory-system-v1

## Execution Sequence

### Phase 1: Foundation Fixes (In Progress)
**Status:** 3/5 complete

- [x] P1 Performance: Semantic search pre-computation (embedding_manager.py)
- [x] P1 Performance: Async consolidation queue (async_consolidation.py)
- [x] P1 Reliability: SQLite backups + VACUUM/ANALYZE (nightly_maintenance_master.py)
- [ ] P1 Performance: Limit Dream Mode to top 1K memories
- [ ] P1 Reliability: Atomic writes for memory-ts (temp file + rename)
- [ ] P1 Reliability: LLM retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] P2 Performance: Connection pooling verification (db_pool.py exists)

### Phase 2: IntelligenceDB Refactor
**Status:** Not Started

Refactor F44-50 to use shared IntelligenceDB:
- F44: Image Memory Capture (voice_capture.py uses own DB)
- F45: Code Snippet Memory (code_memory.py uses own DB)
- F46: Decision Journal (decision_journal.py uses own DB)
- F47: A/B Testing for Memory Strategies (needs migration)
- F48: Cross-System Learning (needs migration)
- F49: Voice Memory Capture (needs migration)
- F50: Dream Mode Synthesis (needs migration)

**Goal:** All features 23-75 share single intelligence.db

### Phase 3: Test Coverage Improvement
**Status:** Not Started

Current: 361/372 passing (97%)
Target: 100% passing

Fix failing tests:
- session_consolidator.py API mismatch (11 failures)

Add missing tests:
- F57: Writing Style Analyzer (18 tests created, need verification)
- F61: A/B Testing Strategies
- F75: Dream Synthesis Enhanced

### Phase 4: Features 51-75 Planning
**Status:** Not Started

25 wild features need requirements clarification:
- F51-54: Reality Distortion Field features
- F56, F58-60: Various wild features
- F64-74: Advanced wild features

**Action:** Deep planning session to spec out requirements

### Phase 5: Build Features 24-32
**Status:** Not Started

Core Intelligence features:
- F24-32: Intelligence Enhancement layer

### Phase 6: Build Features 36-75
**Status:** Not Started

Remaining features:
- F36-43: Integration features
- F51-75: Wild features (after planning)

### Phase 7: Deep QA Pass
**Status:** Not Started

**Team:** 7-agent QA swarm
**Output:** QA-FINDINGS.md
**Scope:** Performance, Reliability, Security, Data Integrity, UX, Code Quality, DevOps

### Phase 8: Product Design Pass
**Status:** Not Started

**Team:** 7-agent design swarm
**Output:** PRODUCT-FINDINGS.md
**Scope:** Feature completeness, UX flow, Integration quality, Documentation, Discoverability

## Open Issues

### Critical
- Dream Mode loads ALL memories (100M comparisons at 10K scale)
- No atomic writes for memory-ts (corruption risk)
- LLM failures cause silent data loss (no retry)

### High
- IntelligenceDB refactor incomplete (F44-50 use separate DBs)
- 11 test failures in session_consolidator
- Connection pooling needs verification

### Medium
- GitHub repo not set up
- Documentation scattered
- No CLI interface (low discoverability)

---

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Limit Dream Mode to top 1K memories by importance + recency
2. Implement atomic writes for memory-ts
3. Add LLM retry logic with exponential backoff
4. Refactor F44-50 to use IntelligenceDB
5. Fix all failing tests
6. Plan features 51-75
7. Build features 24-32 and 36-75
8. Deep QA pass → fix all findings
9. Product design pass → fix all findings
