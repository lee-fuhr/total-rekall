Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Test files for F61 and F75** - Created `tests/wild/test_ab_tester.py` (4 tests) and `tests/wild/test_dream_synthesizer.py` (4 tests) for basic module initialization and data structure validation

### Fixed
- **IntelligenceDB initialization bug** (src/intelligence_db.py:45) - Fixed AttributeError where `self.conn.row_factory` was accessed before `self.conn` was initialized. Now properly initializes connection from pool before setting row_factory.
- **PooledConnection attribute proxy** (src/db_pool.py) - Added `__setattr__` method to properly proxy attribute writes (like `row_factory`) to the underlying sqlite3.Connection object.
- **MemoryTSClient API mismatch** (src/session_consolidator.py:564) - Fixed incorrect `search()` call using non-existent `query=` and `limit=` parameters. Now correctly uses `content=` parameter as defined in MemoryTSClient API.
- **Test coverage improvement** - Fixed 12 intelligence_db tests (0/12 → 12/12), 11 session_consolidator tests (14/26 → 25/26), and added 8 new wild feature tests

### Changed
- Repository cleanup: Archived obsolete documentation (PHASE-*.md, old QA passes, _working/) to _archive/

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- embedding_manager.py: Persistent embedding storage with SHA-256 content hashing
- async_consolidation.py: Queue-based async consolidation system
- nightly_maintenance_master.py: Orchestrates all nightly jobs
- scripts/consolidation_worker.py: Background worker for async processing
- scripts/nightly_embedding_precompute.py: Pre-computes embeddings nightly
- hooks/session-memory-consolidation-async.py: Fast SessionEnd hook (<1s)
- PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS.md: Comprehensive scaling analysis by Performance Architect
- RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS.md: Failure modes and recovery by Reliability Engineer
- UX-ANALYSIS.md: Usability assessment by UX Reviewer
- tests/wild/test_writing_analyzer.py: 18 tests for F57 Writing Style Analyzer

### Changed
- Semantic search now uses pre-computed embeddings from intelligence.db (500s → <1s)
- Session consolidation moved to async queue (60-120s hook → <1s)
- Database optimization (VACUUM + ANALYZE) now runs nightly
- SQLite backups automated with 7-day retention

### Fixed
- Semantic search O(n) embedding bottleneck
- SessionEnd hook timeout risk from blocking consolidation
- Unbounded in-memory embedding cache (memory leak)

### Performance Impact
- Semantic search: 500s → <1s per search at 10K memories
- Hook execution: 60-120s → <1s (queue only)
- API costs at 10K scale: $1,000/day → $4/day (with optimizations)
