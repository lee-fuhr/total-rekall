## [0.17.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added — Intelligence layer (tier 2 complete)
- **Cluster-based morning briefing** — `src/cluster_briefing.py`: `ClusterBriefing` class reads memory clusters from intelligence.db, generates `MorningBriefing` with top clusters, content previews, divergence signals. `/api/briefing` dashboard endpoint.
- **FAISS vector store** — `src/vector_store.py`: `VectorStore` class backed by FAISS `IndexFlatIP` (L2-normalized inner product = cosine similarity). Persistent save/load, batch operations, SQLite migration. Dual-write in `embedding_manager.py` (FAISS primary, SQLite fallback). Chose over ChromaDB due to Python 3.14 pydantic incompatibility.
- **Intelligence orchestrator** — `src/intelligence_orchestrator.py`: Central "brain stem" collecting signals from 5 sources (dream synthesis, momentum tracking, energy scheduling, regret detection, frustration events). Synthesizes into prioritized `DailyBriefing`. `/api/intelligence` dashboard endpoint.
- **Cross-client pattern synthesizer** — `src/cross_client_synthesizer.py`: Reads global-scope and consent-tagged memories, groups by knowledge domain, generates `TransferHypothesis` with confidence boosted by prior transfer effectiveness. `/api/cross-client` dashboard endpoint.
- **Decision regret loop** — `src/decision_regret_loop.py`: Real-time warning before repeating regretted decisions. Fuzzy keyword matching against historical `decision_outcomes` table, decision categorization, formatted warnings with regret rate and alternatives. `/api/regret-check` dashboard endpoint.
- **Embeddings migration script** — `scripts/migrate_embeddings_to_faiss.py`: One-time migration from SQLite embeddings to FAISS index.

### Tests
- 20 new tests in `tests/test_cluster_briefing.py`
- 24 new tests in `tests/test_vector_store.py`
- 20 new tests in `tests/test_intelligence_orchestrator.py`
- 25 new tests in `tests/test_cross_client_synthesizer.py`
- 24 new tests in `tests/test_decision_regret_loop.py`

### Status

- **Features shipped:** 58 + 10 dashboard/infra improvements
- **Backlog tier 2:** Complete (items #6-#10 shipped)

---

## [0.16.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added — Dashboard UX + freshness review
- **"Explain why" on search results** — `_extract_snippet()` centers ~120-char window on match, `_match_reasons()` identifies body/tag/domain matches. Search cards show highlighted snippet + match reason tags.
- **Memory freshness indicators** — `days_stale` field on `/api/memories`, CSS opacity classes (stale-1/2/3), colored freshness pips (green/amber/yellow/rose), stale toggle filter
- **Memory freshness review cycle** — `src/memory_freshness_reviewer.py`: `scan_stale_memories()`, `refresh_memory()`, `archive_memory()`, interactive CLI review, Pushover notification summary, weekly LaunchAgent (Sundays 9am)
- **Session replay modal** — click session row to view transcript turns + linked memories. `/api/session/<id>` endpoint with `_summarise_transcript()`. Shows user/assistant turns with 300-char previews, session stats, memory chips
- **GitHub Actions CI** — `.github/workflows/test.yml`: pytest on push/PR, Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 matrix, pip caching, ignores tests/wild

### Tests
- 16 new tests in `tests/test_dashboard_search.py` (snippet extraction, match reasons)
- 18 new tests in `tests/test_memory_freshness_reviewer.py` (scan, refresh, archive, summary, _days_since)

### Status
- **Test suite:** 1,145 passing (34 new tests)
- **Features shipped:** 58 + 5 dashboard/infra improvements

---

## [0.15.0] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed — Consolidation hook broken since Feb 12
- **`dashboard_export.py` IndentationError** — entire `with` block body was at wrong indent level, causing import-time crash
- **Hook using system python instead of venv** — `python3` couldn't resolve `from memory_system.config import cfg`; changed to `~/.local/venvs/memory-system/bin/python3`
- **5 days of sessions had zero memories captured** — all consolidation attempts failed silently since Feb 12

### Added — Pushover notification on consolidation
- Hook now sends push notification via Pushover when new memories are saved or reinforcements detected
- Notification includes: memories saved, deduplicated, reinforcements, promotions, high-value count
- Gracefully fails — doesn't break the hook if Pushover is unavailable

### Status
- **Test suite:** 1,111 passing (pre-existing flaky tests unchanged)
- **Features shipped:** 58

---

## [0.14.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added — Circuit breaker + Total Recall rename
- **Circuit breaker for LLM calls (TDD)** — `src/circuit_breaker.py` with CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states, 3-failure threshold, 60s recovery timeout, thread-safe via `threading.Lock`, singleton registry via `get_breaker(name)`
- **12 circuit breaker tests** — state machine (6), registry (3), edge cases (3)
- **Wired into 3 LLM call sites:** `llm_extractor.extract_with_llm()` → breaker "llm_extraction", `llm_extractor.ask_claude()` → breaker "llm_ask_claude", `contradiction_detector.ask_claude_quick()` → breaker "llm_contradiction"

### Changed — Rename to Total Recall + charter
- **Project renamed from Engram to Total Recall** across all files (dashboard, pyproject.toml, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, all tracking docs)
- **README rewritten** with project charter framing: every methodology, all additive, predict what's next
- **SHOWCASE updated** with charter statement, current stats (1,111 tests), and condensed progress log

### Status
- **Test suite:** 1,111 passing, 2 skipped (99.8%)
- **Features shipped:** 58

---

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added — Dashboard enhancements
- **Memory detail modal** — click any memory card to see full content, metadata, tags, and grade info in an overlay
- **`/api/memory/<id>` endpoint** — returns full body, all metadata for a single memory
- **Export (JSON + CSV)** — `/api/export?format=json|csv` endpoint + export buttons in Memories tab
- **LaunchAgent** — `com.lfi.total-recall-dashboard.plist` auto-starts dashboard on login with KeepAlive
- **Prioritized backlog** — `BACKLOG.md` with 23 items across 5 tiers (compiled from ideas.md, UX analysis, ROADMAP)

### Fixed
- Wordmark in dashboard: Mnemora → Total Recall
- YAML frontmatter parser: single-quoted arrays (`['tag1', 'tag2']`) now parsed as lists instead of strings (was causing character-by-character iteration in export/display)
- `.gitignore` — added BACKLOG.md to excluded working docs

---

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added — Total Recall dashboard
- **`dashboard/server.py`** — Flask server with JSON API endpoints (`/api/stats`, `/api/memories`, `/api/sessions`, `/api/refresh`)
- **`dashboard/index.html`** — full-stack UI with Obsidian + amber design (Fraunces + IBM Plex Mono/Sans)
  - Overview: stat cards, grade distribution bar, domain bars, 26-week activity heatmap
  - Memories: searchable/filterable cards with grade indicators, pagination
  - Sessions: table with date, name, message/tool/memory counts
  - Knowledge map: tag cloud (frequency-scaled) + domain breakdown
  - Sidebar with domain quick-filters

### Fixed
- Memories tab race condition — eliminated with concurrent load guard
- Error handling for API failures in frontend

---

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-16

### Changed — Rename to Total Recall
- Project renamed from Mnemora to Total Recall throughout (commit c8a7545)
- README, dashboard, CHANGELOG, package metadata all updated

### Fixed
- **F30→F28 search delegation** — `MemoryAwareSearch.search()` now delegates to `SearchOptimizer.search_with_cache()` + `rank_results()` instead of bare client call
- **IntelligenceDB connection leak** — replaced `pool.get_connection()` with `sqlite3.connect()` directly (pool connections were borrowed at init and never returned)
- **Dream Mode O(n²)** — `MAX_MEMORIES = 1000` cap confirmed in place

---

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added — Config centralization
- **`src/config.py`** — `MemorySystemConfig` frozen dataclass, module singleton `cfg`. All paths and constants overridable via `MEMORY_SYSTEM_*` env vars.
- Centralized: `memory_dir`, `session_dir`, `project_id`, `session_db_path`, `shared_db_path`, `fsrs_db_path`, `intelligence_db_path`, `cluster_db_path`, `max_pre_compaction_facts`, `cache_ttl_seconds`

### Changed
- `session_history_db.py` — `SESSION_DB_PATH` now reads from `cfg`
- `shared_knowledge.py` — `SHARED_DB_PATH` now reads from `cfg`
- `session_consolidator.py` — hardcoded `~/.claude/projects` → `cfg.session_dir`
- `fsrs_scheduler.py` — relative `Path(__file__)` → `cfg.fsrs_db_path`
- `intelligence/search_optimizer.py` — relative `Path(__file__)` → `cfg.intelligence_db_path`

### Fixed
- `test_search_optimizer.py` — `sys.modules` mock patched wrong key (`memory_ts_client` → `memory_system.memory_ts_client`) after import migration

### Status
- **Test suite:** 1085 passing, 2 flaky (LLM timeout — pre-existing), 2 skipped (99.6%)

---

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-15

### Changed — Package infrastructure + import cleanup
- **`pyproject.toml`** — package now installable via `pip install -e .`. Maps `memory_system` → `src/` via `[tool.setuptools.package-dir]`.
- **`conftest.py`** — minimal root conftest enables pytest discovery without sys.path tricks
- **Venv** — at `~/.local/venvs/memory-system/` (project is in Google Drive, can't create venv inside)
- **All imports standardized** — `from memory_system.X import ...` everywhere. Removed 71 sys.path hacks across tests, src, hooks, and scripts.

### Fixed
- Pre-existing ordering bug in `scripts/nightly_maintenance_master.py` — `SCRIPTS_DIR` used before definition

### Status
- **sys.path hacks remaining:** 2 (intentional — `decision_journal.py` optional ea_brain integration, `update_fsrs_manual.py` code generator)
- **Test suite:** 1085 passing (was 1086 before fix noted above)

---

- **semantic_search.py** — 72 new tests (vector similarity, ranking, filters)
- **hybrid_search.py** — 73 new tests (combined scoring, query parsing, project scoping)
- **session_history_db.py** — 65 new tests (transcript storage, search, stats)
- **Total added:** 322 tests

### Fixed
- 3 bugs in `session_history_db.py` found during test writing: docstring syntax error, indentation error, FTS5 bad column reference

### Status
- **Test suite:** 1086 passing, 2 skipped (was 765 before this release)

---

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-13

### Changed
- **F63 (Prompt Evolution)** — discovered already built and shipped; updated all docs to correctly reflect 58 features

### Fixed - Test Suite Cleanup
- **All failures resolved** - 8 failing tests → 0 failing (765 passing, 2 skipped)
- **F29 Smart Alerts test API mismatch** - Tests used `priority` parameter but implementation uses `severity`. Fixed `get_pending_alerts()` → `get_unread_alerts()`, `mark_delivered()` → `dismiss_alert()`.
- **F31 TopicSummary dataclass** - Tests omitted required fields `summary_id`, `created_at`, `memory_ids`.
- **F51 Temporal Predictor hook import contamination** - Fixed with `_load_hook_module()` helper that forces clean reload.

Generates 2-3 paragraph summaries via Sonnet 4.5 with fallback to generic summaries on timeout. 17 comprehensive tests covering initialization, cluster/project/period summarization, filtering, regeneration, statistics, and LLM fallback.

---

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- **F28 cache bug (CRITICAL)** - Fixed cache hit hydration that was still calling `search_fn()` on cache hit, making cache non-functional. Cache now properly hydrates Memory objects from cached IDs using MemoryTSClient.get() with FileNotFoundError handling for deleted memories.
- **F28 cache key mismatch** - Fixed `invalidate_cache()` to use same composite key format as storage: `{query}|{project_id or 'global'}` instead of just query hash.
- **F28 test coverage** - Updated `test_cache_hit_second_search()` to verify search_fn NOT called on cache hit. Fixed `test_cache_invalidation()` to use correct composite key format. Added `test_cache_efficiency()` to verify cache prevents redundant search calls across 10 consecutive hits.

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **F24: Memory Relationship Mapping** - Graph-based relationship system with 5 types (causal, contradicts, supports, requires, related), BFS causal chain discovery, bidirectional queries, contradiction detection, and global/per-memory statistics. 28 comprehensive tests covering initialization, link creation, retrieval, causal chains, contradictions, updates/deletions, and statistics.
- **F27: Memory Reinforcement Scheduler** - FSRS-6 based review scheduling with due review surfacing, review history tracking, and automatic rescheduling. Progressive interval doubling for non-FSRS memories. 24 tests covering initialization, scheduling, due reviews, recording, rescheduling, statistics, and FSRS integration.
- **F28: Memory Search Optimization** - Query result caching with 24h TTL and project-scoped cache keys. Improved ranking algorithm: semantic (0.5) + keyword (0.2) + recency (0.2) + importance (0.1) with clamped recency scores. Search analytics tracking for future CTR learning. 14 tests covering initialization, caching (miss/hit/expiry/invalidation), ranking, selection recording, and analytics.
- **F51: Temporal Pattern Prediction** - Learns temporal patterns from memory access behavior and predicts needs proactively. Passive learning logs every memory access (time/day/context). Pattern detection identifies daily/weekly/monthly patterns (min 3 occurrences). Feedback loop (confirm/dismiss) adjusts confidence. Topic resumption detector hook auto-surfaces memories when user references past discussions. 25 tests covering access logging, pattern detection, prediction, feedback loop, hook integration, and MemoryTSClient instrumentation.
- **Test files for F61 and F75** - Created `tests/wild/test_ab_tester.py` (4 tests) and `tests/wild/test_dream_synthesizer.py` (4 tests) for basic module initialization and data structure validation
- **Progressive timeout increases in ask_claude** - LLM retry logic now increases timeout on each attempt: initial → +10s → +20s (e.g., 30s → 40s → 50s). Gives Claude more time on retries.
- **Planning documentation** - Created comprehensive implementation plans for F24 (relationship mapping), F27 (reinforcement scheduler), F28 (search optimization), plus feature specs for F24-32 (intelligence enhancement), F36-43 (integrations - deferred), and F51-75 (wild features with tier prioritization).

### Fixed
- **IntelligenceDB initialization bug** (src/intelligence_db.py:45) - Fixed AttributeError where `self.conn.row_factory` was accessed before `self.conn` was initialized. Now properly initializes connection from pool before setting row_factory.
- **PooledConnection attribute proxy** (src/db_pool.py) - Added `__setattr__` method to properly proxy attribute writes (like `row_factory`) to the underlying sqlite3.Connection object.
- **MemoryTSClient API mismatch** (src/session_consolidator.py:564) - Fixed incorrect `search()` call using non-existent `query=` and `limit=` parameters. Now correctly uses `content=` parameter as defined in MemoryTSClient API.
- **Deduplication LLM timeout** (src/session_consolidator.py:421) - Fixed timeout in `_smart_dedup_decision` by increasing from 10s to 30s, reducing retries from 3 to 2, and adding fallback to similarity-based decision (>0.75 = duplicate) when LLM times out.
- **SQL WHERE clause precedence** (src/intelligence/relationship_mapper.py) - Fixed operator precedence issue when combining OR and AND conditions by wrapping OR conditions in parentheses: `(from_memory_id = ? OR to_memory_id = ?) AND relationship_type = ?`
- **Test coverage improvement** - Fixed 12 intelligence_db tests (0/12 → 12/12), 12 session_consolidator tests (14/26 → 26/26), added 8 new wild feature tests, and added 28 relationship mapping tests

### Changed
- Repository cleanup: Archived obsolete documentation (PHASE-*.md, old QA passes, _working/) to _archive/
- **SHOWCASE.md rewrite** - Restructured using VBF framework (Values → Benefits → Features). Leads with problem/pain, shows how world improves, grounds all features in benefits.

---

- Session consolidation moved to async queue (60-120s hook → <1s)
- Database optimization (VACUUM + ANALYZE) now runs nightly
- SQLite backups automated with 7-day retention

### Fixed
- Semantic search O(n) embedding bottleneck
- SessionEnd hook timeout risk from blocking consolidation
- Unbounded in-memory embedding cache (memory leak)

### Performance Impact
- Semantic search: 500s → <1s per search at 10K memories
- Hook execution: 60-120s → <1s (queue only)
