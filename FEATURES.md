## Architecture

**Single database** — All features share `intelligence.db` with schema namespacing. Enables cross-feature queries like "show A-grade memories that triggered frustration warnings."

**Local embeddings** — sentence-transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). No API costs per query. 384-dim vectors. Runs offline.

**Hybrid search** — 70% semantic + 30% BM25 keyword. Semantic understanding meets exact-match precision.

**FAISS vector store** — `IndexFlatIP` with L2-normalized inner product (= cosine similarity). Dual-write: FAISS for fast indexed search, SQLite fallback for compatibility.

**FSRS-6 spaced repetition** — Tracks memory stability, difficulty, and intervals. FAIL/HARD/GOOD/EASY grading on reinforcements.

**Circuit breaker** — CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states. 3-failure threshold, 60s recovery timeout. Separate breakers per LLM call pathway.

**Additive design** — New features layer on existing, never replace. The contradiction detector doesn't disable the quality grader — it feeds it. Adding feature N+1 makes features 1 through N better.
