# Memory System v1 — Handoff

**Session:** current
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Version:** v0.12.0 (dashboard shipped)

---

## What was done this session

### Mnemora dashboard shipped ✅
- `dashboard/server.py`: Flask server with `/api/stats`, `/api/memories`, `/api/sessions`
  - Parses `---` bounded YAML frontmatter from 1,255 `.md` memory files
  - Quality grades A/B/C/D by importance_weight (≥0.8 = A, ≥0.6 = B, etc.)
  - 500 sessions from `session-history.db`, activity-by-day for heatmap
  - Text search, domain/tag filters, sort by importance or recency
  - Run: `python3 dashboard/server.py --port 7860 --project LFI`
  - Opens at: http://localhost:7860
- `dashboard/index.html`: Full-stack UI
  - Obsidian + amber design (Fraunces + IBM Plex Mono/Sans)
  - Overview: stat cards, grade bar, domain bars, 26-week activity heatmap
  - Memories: searchable/filterable cards with grade indicators, load-more
  - Sessions: table with date, name, messages, tools, memories extracted
  - Knowledge map: tag cloud (frequency-scaled) + domain breakdown
  - Sidebar nav with domain quick-filters

### Previous session (v0.11.0)

### Task #7: F30 delegates to F28 search backend ✅
- `src/automation/search.py`: added `SearchOptimizer` import + `self.optimizer` in `__init__`
- `search()`: now uses `optimizer.search_with_cache()` + `rank_results()` instead of bare client call
- `search_advanced()`: text queries go through optimizer cache (with project_id scoping)
- relevance sort delegates to `optimizer.rank_results()` (multi-factor: semantic + recency + importance)
- NLP parsing layer (`parse_natural_query`) unchanged — stays as preprocessing layer

### Task #8: IntelligenceDB connection leak fixed ✅
- `src/intelligence_db.py:44`: replaced `pool.get_connection()` with `sqlite3.connect()` directly
- Pool connections were borrowed at `__init__` time and never returned → pool starvation
- Now uses a direct sqlite3 connection; `close()` still properly cleans up
- Removed unused `get_connection` import
- Kept `self.conn` API unchanged — all callers (`code_memory.py`, tests, etc.) work unmodified

### Task #9: Dream Mode O(n²) ✅ (was already done in prev session)
- `MAX_MEMORIES = 1000` at line 89, `_load_memories()` limit at line 228 — both in place
- Confirmed by code review: fix was applied but not checked off in prev HANDOFF

## Current test state

```
All targeted tests: 43 search + 62 db_pool/intelligence_db = 105 passing
All 3 background test suite runs: exit code 0
Known flaky (LLM timeout — pre-existing): 2 tests
```

Known flaky (not bugs):
- `tests/test_session_consolidator.py::TestDeduplication::test_deduplicate_against_existing`
- `tests/wild/test_dream_synthesizer.py::test_temporal_connection_discovery`

## Remaining tasks / ideas

**Core dashboard:** Done. Running at http://localhost:7860

**Potential next steps:**
- Rename project from "memory-system-v1" to "Mnemora" throughout (package name, README title, pyproject.toml)
- Backlog: compile Reddit ideas + 20 futuristic features into prioritized list
- LaunchAgent to auto-start dashboard on login
- Memory detail modal (click a card → full content view)
- Export memories as JSON/CSV from dashboard

## Key technical facts

### Package setup
```bash
# Venv (NOT inside Google Drive)
~/.local/venvs/memory-system/

# Install
pip install -e "/Users/lee/CC/LFI/_ Operations/memory-system-v1"

# Run tests (exclude wild LLM-dependent tests if in a hurry)
cd "/Users/lee/CC/LFI/_ Operations/memory-system-v1"
~/.local/venvs/memory-system/bin/python3 -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/wild -q
```

### Config system
```python
from memory_system.config import cfg
cfg.project_id       # "LFI"
cfg.session_db_path  # ~/.local/share/memory/LFI/session-history.db
cfg.fsrs_db_path     # ~/.local/share/memory/fsrs.db
# Override via env: MEMORY_SYSTEM_PROJECT_ID=TEST
```

### Import convention
```python
# Full package path everywhere (no bare imports)
from memory_system.intelligence.summarization import MemorySummarizer, TopicSummary
from memory_system.automation.summarization import AutoSummarization  # alias
from memory_system.automation.search import MemoryAwareSearch  # delegates to SearchOptimizer
from memory_system.intelligence.search_optimizer import SearchOptimizer  # F28 backend
```
